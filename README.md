# Play-Cucumber

A recreation of http://www.sebnozzi.com/82/cucumber-and-play/ using Play 2.4.x and cucumber-scala.

Play 2.4.x must be used here, as there doesn't seem to be a 2.11.x version of the sbt-cucumber plugin used.

Note that this uses compile time dependency injection and has overrides for GuiceApplicationBuilder in place for scalatestplus-play.
